Extract image from video footage.
Identify vehicles in image frame using YOLOv7. Assign a unique ID for each vehicle.
Localize number plate of vehicles present in frame using YOLOv7.
Upscale the cropped image from YOLOv7 using SRGAN to increase accuracy of recognition.
Recognize characters in upscaled image using OCR algorithms. Assign ID to number plate. Output will be the final recognized vehicle number with ID.
In the output of image from step 2, train to read the particular classesâ€™ features and embed the features.
Classify the face in image based on feature embeddings using Support Vector Machines.
Using the output form previous step, recognize the face if it is encountered in future
Assign corresponding vehicle number to the recognized face. Output should be recognized face with the ID.
Add the Face and vehicle number along with its vehicle ID to database.

Design a distributed system to identify and track driver and license number of vehicles. 
The system performs object detection to track vehicles and performs isolated tasks Automated Number Plate Recognition and Facial Recognition.
The ANPR system localizes License Plates using YOLOv7, and upscales them using SRGAN. The license number is then recognized using OCR and mapped in databse with respective id.
Similarily the facial embeddings of driver is extracted and stored to the same database.
